    <p class="card-text">With onion prices remaining high and unstable, consumers are bearing the brunt of high prices of essential foods, including vegetables, according to shoppers and market data.

Onion prices, which began falling after hitting a historic high of around Tk 250 per kilogram, increased again since the beginning of this week amid supply shortage due to low import and a declining stock of locally grown bulbs.

Yesterday, prices of the essential spice, used mainly for cooking, rose both at wholesale and retail levels and the bulb was found being sold up to Tk 240 per kg, said retailers in several markets of the city.

“Prices usually fall when there is ample supply. But supply of domestically grown and imported onions has been below the required amount,” said Mohammad Shahidul Islam Mia, owner of Matribhandar, an onion wholesaler at Shyambazar -- the biggest wholesale market in Dhaka.

He said prices of locally grown onion rose yesterday for the lack of availability at bazars of onion-producing region Pabna.

The Basics of Search Engine Optimization
Ever heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It's a theory of psychology that prioritizes the most fundamental human needs (like air, water, and physical safety) over more advanced needs (like esteem and social belonging). The theory is that you can't achieve the needs at the top without ensuring the more fundamental needs are met first. Love doesn't matter if you don't have food.

Our founder, Rand Fishkin, made a similar pyramid to explain the way folks should go about SEO, and we've affectionately dubbed it "Mozlow's hierarchy of SEO needs."
